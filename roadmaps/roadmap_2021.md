# OpenMDAO 2021 Development Roadmap


Author: Justin S. Gray   
Date: 2020-08-24

## What is this roadmap for?

This document represents the perspective of the OpenMDAO development 
team on what we feel will be the most important areas to focus on for 
framework development in 2021. It is intended to communicate this 
perspective to the OpenMDAO user community, and to provide a basis for
feedback. It is not intended to be all-encompassing or a binding 
development plan, but should be regarded as an indication of the 
current direction of the core development team. Also, it should be 
clearly understood that there is very probably more listed here than 
can actually be accomplished in a single year! 

## Summary of major progress from 2020 

In 2019, we focused heavily on improving performance. 
2020 saw much more effort going into improving APIs and general usability. 

### V3 release
OpenMDAO V3 release was completed. Python 2 no longer supported. 
As of the date of this document OpenMDAO V3.2 has been released. 

### Model Data and Visualization 

We completed a major re-factor of the N2 diagram, including a new UI concept 
and modernized look and feel. Performance improvements for larger models were 
added to make the N2 more usable for deeply nested hierarchies. 

More metadata is now included in the N2, allowing users to see details about 
groups, components, and variables via the information tool. 

We did not make much progress on the inclusion of model data and plotting 
into the visualization. It took longer than expected to refactor the N2 as is. 
This goal will be carried into 2021. 

### HPC Support 
While a standardized HPC test case was not built, there is a larger generalized 
effort Mphys which focuses on modular integration of PDE solvers. 
This has resulted in use cases with aerostructural, aerothermal, and aeropropulsive applications. 

The original planned development goal was to focus on reducing memory 
usage and duplicate data transfers. However, with the use cases mentioned 
above it became clear that some more foundational changes to the setup 
stack were needed. The memory efficiency goals were postponed in favor 
these API level improvements. 

The improvements include the ability to create I/O during the configure method, 
the ability to query variable metadata from any level of the model hierarchy during configure, 
and the addition of the auto-ivc capabilities. 


### Improved Differentiation Tools

We refined and tested the partial derivative coloring features, 
which work well for FD and CS partial derivatives. 
This feature proved useful and fairly efficient for highly sparse 
component calculations. It is particularly effective when you have 
vectorized array calculations that have purely diagonal partial 
derivative sparsity structure. 

We did not have time to focus on true algorithmic differentiation capability. 
This is still an area of interest, but the development team didn't have a strong 
enough internal use case to focus on it.
It is still not clear that AD in python is a viable long term strategy. 
We did some investigation into coupling with Julia, which does have a 
strong AD development effort. 
See https://github.com/byuflowlab/OpenMDAO.jl for our collaboration 
with the BYU Flow Lab. 

We found the julia wrapper to be effective and a good choice for more 
complex and costly calculations that would be difficult to implement 
efficiently in pure python. The added benefit of AD makes it a compelling 
future development path. There are some clear downsides though. 
The need to have expertise in both Julia and Python is a major one, 
though the syntax is close enough in most cases that this is not insurmountable. 
The larger challenge is the difficulty of getting packages installed 
because you have to manage both a Python and a Julia package and install both. 
It adds significant user hassle when codes are changing often. 

### OpenMDAO POEM and Plugins

When we first proposed the POEM process, Justin Gray guessed that there would be 
less than 10 POEMS per year. He was wrong! 
As of the date of this document, there were 31 POEMS proposed in 2020. 


#2021 main focus areas

- Model visualization and data post processing

- Building an OpenMDAO training course

- Benchmarking OpenMDAO Performance for large scale HPC applications

# Model Visualization and Data Post Processing
Overall, we feel that this is an area of OpenMDAO that can still 
use significant improvement. The 2020 N2 refactor improved things somewhat, 
but we think that tighter integration with case recorder data will greatly 
enhance the user experience. 

## 1) Integrated case data into N2 
### Goal: 
Allow users to view the numerical values for all variables from a single case, or a set of cases within the N2 viewer. 

### Potential Challenges: 
The value of the stand-alone HTML based N2 has been clearly demonstrated. 
It is portable and easily shared. We don't want to give up that functionality. 
We can definitely integrate data from a single case within that 
stand-alone HTML structure. However, enabling multiple cases will be more 
challenging because file size will quickly get out of control and performance may be an issue. 

We'll be forced to consider an external application for the N2. 
We have the prototype based on Electron already, but are also considering
a Jupyter based solution. Regardless, some kind of additional application 
will be required for multi-case capability. 

## 2) Plotting tool for case data
### Goal: 
Improve the usability of the case recorder databases, 
and allow rapid navigation and plotting of results. 
We've noticed that users can sometimes struggle with our case databases, 
and we hope a graphical navigation tool for post processing and simple 
plotting will help with that. 

### Potential Challenges 
Similar to the multi-case data N2 concept, this functionality will 
likely be built into a separate stand alone application. 

We have also considered a reduced functionality version of this feature 
built into the OpenMDAO command line tool, based on matplotlib. 
This liter version may be done instead of a stand alone tool or in addition to it. 


# Building and OpenMDAO Training Course 
We've seen that as users get more comfortable with OpenMDAO
the size of the models they can build grows quickly, both in terms of 
the number of components and the complexity of their couplings. 

One problem can then arise when the problem complexity grows to the point that 
converging the solver or the optimizers becomes a real bottle neck. 
We can and will provide better debugging tools, but there is a certain amount of practical 
knowledge and experience about solvers and optimizers that is still required. 

Since OpenMDAO has enabled users to build models of this level of complexity, 
we think some practical training is needed to make those models more useful for them. 

## 1) Develop a class for building implicit models and improving their convergence
### Goal: 
Provide users with a functional introduction to implicit systems, with a focus on 
when and how to apply specific kinds of solvers. 
Specifically focus on the use of BalanceComps, their role in model building, and how to enhance convergence. Also focus on techniques for debugging a model when it won't converge. 

## 2) Develop a class for practical optimization based around OpenMDAO 
Having a flexible optimization framework is a bit of a double edges sword, 
because it allows you to create any problem formulation you want... even a bad one! 
This course will teach the rules for proper optimization formulation, 
techniques for improving convergence and performance, and debugging processes for when 
the optimization inevitably doesn't do what you want it to!

# Benchmarking OpenMDAO Performance for large scale HPC applications
Initial benchmarking results comparing OpenMDAO based shape optimization
to a stand-alone implementation have shown that for very small CFD 
problems, OpenMDAO has roughly 10% high compute cost. 
We also know that OpenMDAO's internal memory allocation scheme is 
inefficient when used with components that have very large state vectors. 

While these issues are not significant for many current CFD based problems, 
we recognize the need to improve the performance to accommodate future 
larger problems. 

## 1) Improved data storage and transfer scheme
### Goal: 
Using benchmark problems from ADFlow, Fun3D, and TACS as a guide, 
reduce the memory usage and computational overhead of an 
OpenMDAO based optimization compared to stand-alone optimizations with each tool. 

### Potential Challenges
We have a concept for a more efficient data storage and transfer 
scheme that will minimize unnecessary data duplication and transfer, 
and our goal is to integrate this new concept while maintaining the 
overall performance and structure of the framework. 

Initial prototyping in 2020 showed that there are some potential 
complexities with this approach and how it related to the nonlinear 
and linear solver architectures. We anticipate some minor refactor of 
internal OpenMDAO APIs to handle this, but its not clear if that will 
leak into component level APIs that affect users or not. 

## 2) Reduce ancillary data storage requirements
### Goal:
Reduce memory allocation for scaling and unit-conversion vectors, 
as well as any other ancillary vectors allocated to the same size as the data arrays. 

### Potential Challenges: 
There are some details about how to write fast numerical operations in python that sometimes require compromises in data allocation that could be avoided with more efficient languages. 
In order to reduce memory overhead, in some situations we may have to switch from a 
single numpy-based element wise operation to a for loop. Its unclear if that switch will force us to trade memory allocation for compute overhead, or if the slower python for loops will be insignificant. 
So this change will require careful benchmarking and profiling.
